## About the Project
### Project Description

This term we were introduced to a Full Stack implementation of a web application, with a focus on combining Front End and Back End technologies into one comprehensive web application. 

We had to build upon the skills developed in Term One and Two by implementing a SPA (Single Page Architecture) style application using the chosen stack technologies (MERN).

I was tasked with researching, analysing, implementing and visualising a eCommerce site of my chosing.

I ended up going with Sneakers as a product.

## Development Process
### Implementation Process

#### Highlights
  * React is very fast in updating the dom as it's Object Oriented
  * Breaking up your web application into components is a very clean and re-useable way of coding
  * Axios is a usefull way of making your API calls and delivers promises which is great when it comes to using the data in the response
  * Routing is a clean and easy way of using your different pages and components, like the navbar, less code is used in the end
#### Challenges
  * Learning what Asynchronous programming is and AsyncAwait was a bit of a challenge getting my head around that
  * Learning to work with the node server was a bit tricky

### Future Implementation

In the future I will probably add more products and more diverse selection of products. I will also add more filter options on my products page.

## Conclusion

I have enjoyed problem solving and developing the SPA web application from the ground up. This was a challenging project but I overcame most of the challenges I faced and Iâ€™m extremely proud of and pleased with the final outcome of my Sneaker eCommerce web application. Working with my own Node server was a challenge but also interesting and I learned quite a bit from it.

Furthering my React skills was awesome along with the very usefull implementation of axios, routing and component based approach. I love using components and Routing espescially.

I will deffinitely be using the technologies learned from throughout the term in future web applications.
