### DV200 MERN STACK
#### INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT 200 | TERM 3

## About the Project
* ### Project Description

This term we were introduced to a Full Stack implementation of a web application, with a focus on combining Front End and Back End technologies into one comprehensive web application. 

We had to build upon the skills developed in Term One and Two by implementing a SPA (Single Page Architecture) style application using the chosen stack technologies (MERN).

I was tasked with researching, analysing, implementing and visualising a eCommerce site of my chosing.

I ended up going with Sneakers as a product.

* ### Built With
   * Node.js
   * Visual Studio Code
   * React
   * Javascript
   * CSS
   * JSX
   * Express.js
   * MongoDB
   * Mongoose
   * joi
   * JWT
   * Bootstrap
   * Axios
   * React-Router-Dom

## Getting Started
* ### Prerequisites
   1. Visual Studio Code
   2. Browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc)
   3. Node.js

* ### How to install

You can find the prerequisites here:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

After you installed the prerequisites you then open up Visual Studio Code (VSC) in a folder where you want to create a React app and run the following inside the terminal in your VSC :
* npx create-react-app .

or

* npx create-react-app applicationName

After the creation of the app you then run the following  also in your terminal inside VSC to install the required dependencies :
* npm i axios
* npm i bootstrap react-bootstrap
* npm i react-router-dom

Finally you run the following in your terminal to start the application :
* npm start

## Features and Functionality

This web application has:
   
   1. A landing page with introductory information, a Slider and a products section, 
   2. A page where you can view all the product and use filters,
   3. A sign up and login modals,
   4. A cart page,
   5. An inventory management page,
   6. An order processing page,
   7. An add product page.

## Development Process
* ### Implementation Process
    * Highlights
      * React is very fast in updating the dom as it's Object Oriented
      * Breaking up your web application into components is a very clean and re-useable way of coding
      * Axios is a usefull way of making your API calls and delivers promises which is great when it comes to using the data in the response
      * Routing is a clean and easy way of using your different pages and components, like the navbar, less code is used in the end
    * Challenges
      * Learning what Asynchronous programming is and AsyncAwait was a bit of a challenge getting my head around that
      * Learning to work with the node server was a bit tricky

## Future Implementation

In the future I will probably add more products and more diverse selection of products. I will also add more filter options on my products page.

## Conclusion

I have enjoyed problem solving and developing the SPA web application from the ground up. This was a challenging project but I overcame most of the challenges I faced and Iâ€™m extremely proud of and pleased with the final outcome of my Sneaker eCommerce web application. Working with my own Node server was a challenge but also interesting and I learned quite a bit from it.

Furthering my React skills was awesome along with the very usefull implementation of axios, routing and component based approach. I love using components and Routing espescially.

I will deffinitely be using the technologies learned from throughout the term in future web applications.
